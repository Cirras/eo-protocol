# EO Protocol

An XML-based specification of the Endless Online network protocol and data files.

## Motivation

Most of this information has been available for some time. It's been scattered through different projects, only partially documented, or living in the heads of various community members.

The idea is to put all of that collective knowledge in one place.

## Use cases

- Documentation
- Code generation
